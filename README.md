# HackLondon2016 - EuroSherpa

This application was created to solve the problem of wanting to go to a country or city and having no idea what to look for. It's easy to look up many great places online, but creating a full game plan for your entire stay is very difficult. Figuring out what awesome places are close together and worth seeing is such a headache. EuroSherpa fixes this problem by tapping into the Google Places API and aggregating ratings per city. Then, using our very own algorithm it selects the best spot for you to be each day giving a suggestion of things to do and when it's worth it to move onto another city.

We hope that this app helps people make more exciting plans and liven up their travel by exposing them to some of the great activities they might not have come to on their own and packing their schedule full of the best experiences.
